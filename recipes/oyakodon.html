    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Oyakodon is a Japanese rice bowl dish made with chicken, egg, and various seasonings. It's a staple dish in our household because it is simple, quick, and delicious. The recipe below makes enough for two people, with some leftovers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li></ul>
    <h5>Seasonings:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup dashi</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp sake</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar</li></ul>
    <h5>To serve:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cup cooked Japanese short grain rice</li>
        <li>small bunch mitsuba (Japanese parsely), or green onion/scallion</li>
        <li>shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dashi, mirin, sake, soy sauce in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup.</li>

        <li>Add sugar and mix all together until sugar is dissolved.</li> 

        <li>Thinly slice the onion and chop mitsuba (or green onion). Beat one egg in a small bowl (you will need to beat another egg when you work on the second batch).</li>

        <li>Slice the chicken thigh diagonally and cut into 1.5" (4 cm) pieces. I recommend using “sogigiri” cutting technique so the chicken will be equal thickness and create more surface area for fast cooking.</li>  

        <li>We make one serving at a time using an 8-inch frying pan (so you can slide the dish onto rice bowl). Divide all the ingredients in half. Add half of the onion in a single layer. Pour roughly 1/3 to ½ of the seasoning mixture (depending on the size of your frying pan, the amount may vary). You will need just enough sauce to cover the onion and chicken.</li>

        <li>Add half of the chicken on top of the onion. Make sure the onion and chicken are evenly distributed. Turn on the heat to medium heat and bring to a boil.</li>

        <li>Once boiling, lower the heat to medium-low heat. Skim off any foam or scum if you see any. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink.</li>

        <li>Slowly and evenly drizzle the beaten egg over the chicken and onion. Cook covered on medium-low heat until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, Oyakodon in Japan is served with an almost set but runny egg.</li>

        <li>Add the mitsuba (or green onion) right before removing from the heat. Pour the chicken and egg on top of steamed rice and drizzle desired amount of remaining sauce.</li>
    </ol>
